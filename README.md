# Stripes
Dynamic image of moving striped patterns that reminds artworks from Bridget Riley and Gerhard Richter or works of fashion designer Paul Smith. User can interact with stripes as they'd be strings that can be moved and dragged but eventually will bounce back if pulled far enough. User can also add/remove stripes, modify color scheme as well pause and download resulting image.
